# ALX-T and Udacity Data Analyst Nanodegree Project Submission

Data Visualization project - Communicate Data Findings

## Dataset 

This dataset found [here](https://community.amstat.org/jointscsg-section/dataexpo/dataexpo2009) reports flights in the United States, including carriers, arrival and departure delays, and reasons for delays, from 1987 to 2008. However, due to the large volume in each year, I chose just the 2008 data. The feature definition can be found [here](https://www.transtats.bts.gov/Fields.asp?gnoyr_VQ=FGJ). 
After some preliminary wrangling, I used the Univariate-Bivariate-Multivariate visualization steps to explore my features of interest.
